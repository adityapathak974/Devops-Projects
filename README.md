# Devops-Projects
In this repository I will upload my projects on DevOps and also Integration of DevOps technology with other technologies like Machine Learning, Git/Github, etc.

Project-1 : Automated WebDevelopment Environment

In this Project I have created an Automated Web Development Environment integrating Git/GitHub, Jenkins and Httpd WebServer in RHEL-8. In this Project the developer just need to Commit the code from his local repository, GitHub will automatically send the code to Jenkins using webhooks as soon as there will be any commit in GitHub repo, and Jenkins will then automatically launch the website into apache2 httpd server which is setup in RHEL-8.

Project-2 : CI/CD DevEnv/ProductionEnv Deployment

In this project I have created Continous Deployment using Git, Jenkins and Docker but it more focused in automation of Developer Environment and Production Envirnoment Deployment.
